2.1.2:
  - Fix precision
  - Allow entering ".4" instead of "0.4"

Known bugs :

  - Cover display wrongly if stack values too long.
  - Some characters are clipped if they are too tall ('µ' for example).
  - The app may become slow if the stack is too deep.

Future updates :
  - Equation solving.
  - Full sympy expression editor with virtual keyboard.
  - Ability to "UNDO" multiple times.
  - More effective stack change to fix big stack depth performance problem.

"Long term" updates:

  - Function pretty view on stack element long press.
  - Documented functions.
  - Landscape mode
  - Tablet mode
  - tap on stack to include in expression when keyboard open ?
  - tap on expression to evaluate ?
  - Auto simplify option ? use kernS if no simplify
  - quick precision with blue button + orange button + number ?
  - option to change screen font size
  - vibration ?
  - symbol page ?
  - switcher de pile
  - save stack

real to integer part
do not clip individual stack flickable (because of symbols going too low like "y" or "µ₀")
Base conversion : hex, dec, bin, oct
