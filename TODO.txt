2.0.1:
  - Unlimited stack.
  - Symbolic backend based on sympy.
  - Option to enable symbolic mode or not.
  - Real time sympy expression validation.
  - Explicit error messages on missing / wrong operand and wrong expression.
  - Precision option for stack display / evaluation.
  - Each stack element is flickable individually if too large.
  - Stack is now flickable in place instead of pull down menu style.
  - Symplify expression function.
  - Hide inactive buttons depending on sub-button activation (orange / blue).
  - Settings page on left swipe.
  - Cleaner code.

2.1.0:
  - Long press on stack value to display context menu :
    - Pick
    - Drop
    - Copy to clipboard
    - Display current trig unit under current expression

Known bugs :

  - Sympy engine is slow to load (~4 seconds).
  - Cover display wrongly if stack values too long.
  - Some characters are clipped if they are too tall ('µ' for example).
  - The app may become slow if the stack is too deep.


Future updates :
  - Equation solving.
  - Full sympy expression editor with virtual keyboard.
  - Ability to "UNDO" multiple times.
  - More effective stack change to fix big stack depth performance problem.

"Long term" updates:

  - Function pretty view on stack element long press.
  - Documented functions.
  - Landscape mode
  - Tablet mode
  - tap on stack to include in expression when keyboard open ?
  - tap on expression to evaluate ?
  - Auto simplify option ? use kernS if no simplify
  - quick precision with blue button + orange button + number ?
  - option to change screen font size
  - vibration ?
  - symbol page ?

real to integer part
do not clip individual stack flickable (because of symbols going too low like "y" or "µ₀")
Base conversion : hex, dec, bin, oct
